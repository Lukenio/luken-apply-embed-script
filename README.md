# Embeddable Loanz.io Form Script

## How to Run

- `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` or `npm start` to run `example` folder locally (accessible at `localhost:8080` by default)
- `yarn run build` or `npm run build` to build and minify script and style (will be located in `dist` folder as `embed.min.js` and `embed.min.css`)

## Notes

Script is written in ES5 to avoid use of transpilers (most likely will increase file size which isn't good).

Also note that you will need to run `build` command every time files changed.
